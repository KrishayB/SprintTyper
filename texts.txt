transcription occurs when dna is used to create a matching mrna strand 0070
translation occurs when ribosomes use mrna to synthesize proteins using amino acids 0083
in dna nucleotide nitrogen base pairing, a always pairs with t, and c always pairs with g 0089
organelles called chloroplasts perform photosynthesis for synthesizing glucose 0078
organelles called mitochondria perform cellular respiration in order to synthesize atp 0086
proteins are synthesized by ribosomes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum 0072
plant cells contain a cell wall made from cellulose, which is made from glucose 0079
the cell's organelles are contained in a gel-like fluid called the cytoplasm 0076
prokaryotes are single-celled organisms that don't have a nucleus or organelles 0079
eukaryotes are multi-celled organisms that have a nucleus as well as organelles 0079
pneumonia is an autoimmune disorder that causes the alveoli to fill with fluid 0078
the alveoli are sacs in the lungs that allow for diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide 0087
emphysema is where the lungs have a reduced ability to expand, causing suffocation 0082
pathology is the study of many different types of diseases or disorders in life 0079
vestigial traits are features whose purposes have no apparent or a reduced function 0083
the science of naming organisms is called taxonomy, and our system uses binomial nomenclature 0093
gene flow occurs when genetic information moves between organisms or populations 0080
phenotypes are the external traits of an organism that results from its genotype, or its genome 0094
a genetic bottleneck occurs when a large part of a population dies off at some point 0084
variation, inheritance, selection, and time are needed in order for natural selection 0085
cladograms and tree diagrams can be used to describe evolutionary relationships 0079
specialists are organisms that require specific conditions in order to live, such as pandas 0091
generalists are organisms that are tolerant to environmental changes, such as bugs 0082
the human genome project was a project set to identify all the genes in human chromosomes 0089
directional selection selects for one extreme phenotype on the bell curve 0073
stabilizing selection selects for an intermediate phenotype on the bell curve 0077
disruptive selection selects for both of the extreme phenotypes on the bell curve 0081
humans have 46 chromosomes, 23 from the mother and 23 from the father 0069
melanin is a pigment produced by melanosomes that causes skin to have color 0075
