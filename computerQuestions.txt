What is the function of transcription?
Create a matching mRNA strand
Synthesize proteins
Locate the DNA within the cell
To help perform photosynthesis
0
Transcription is a process that is performed to create an mRNA strand using DNA. Translation is often confused with this, but translation is just for creating proteins.
Why does translation occur?
To help locate white blood cells
To synthesize ATP
To synthesize proteins
To help with cellular respiration
2
Translation is performed for synthesizing proteins using an mRNA strand. Transcription is often confused with this, but remember that transcription is used for "scripting" an mRNA strand.
What nucleotide base does A pair with in DNA?
C
T
G
U
1
A, which stands for adenine, always pairs with thymine. C (cytosine) pairs with G (guanine), and U (uracil) takes the place of thymine in mRNA.
Which process do chloroplasts perform?
Cellular respiration
Photosynthesis
Smelling
Metabolism regulation
1
Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis because they are located in plant cells and NOT in animal cells.
Which process do mitochondria perform?
Cellular respiration
Photosynthesis
Smelling
Metabolism regulation
0
Mitochondria are in both plant and animal cells, but they ALWAYS perform cellular respiration.
Where are proteins synthesized?
Rough endoplasmic reticulum
Golgi apparatus
Vesicle
Alveoli
0
Proteins get sent to the Golgi apparatus to be modified, and there, they are packaged in a vesicle. Alveoli are located in the lungs for gas diffusion. As a result, the rough ER is where proteins are synthesized.
Do plant cells have a cell wall?
No
Maybe
Sometimes
Yes
3
ALL plant cells have a cell wall. Animal cells do not have a cell wall.
What is the gel-like fluid in cells called?
Water
Blood
Cytoplasm
Plasma
2
Water is in cells, and it is ONE OF THE MATERIALS that make up the cytoplasm (other materials include various salts and and molecules). Blood doesn't directly flow into cells, and plasma is the liquid in blood.
Which cell parts do prokaryotes not have?
Nucleus
Organelles
Both nucleus and organelles
None of the options
2
Prokaryotes are simpler than eukaryotes, and they were on this planet before eukaryotes. It is said that at one point, a prokaryotic cell must have consumed another prokaryote, causing eukaryotic cells to develop. Since they are simpler, they don't have a nucleus or organelles.
Are eukaryotes single or multi celled?
Single-celled
Multi-celled
Both
It depends
1
Eukaryotes came after prokaryotes, and it is said that a prokaryotic cell must have consumed another prokaryote, causing eukaryotic cells to develop. Eukaryotic cells are more complex and have organelles as well as a nucleus.
Which autoimmune disorder affects the alveoli?
Emphysema
Laryngitis
Bronchitis
Pneumonia
3
Emphysema is the reduced ability of the lungs to expand and contract; laryngitis is inflammation of the larynx; bronchitis is inflamation of the bronchi; pneumonia is an autoimmune disorder affecting the alveoli.
Which gases do the alveoli allow the diffusion of?
Oxygen
Carbon dioxide
Both
None of the gases
2
Alveoli allow the diffusion of oxygen into capillaries and the diffusion of carbon dioxide out of the capillaries.
How does emphysema usually cause a person to die?
Suffocation
Dehydration
Drowning
None of the options
0
Since emphysema is the reduced ability of the lungs to expand, the lungs will not be able to expand at one point in a person's life. It's a scary, but the person won't be able to perform respiration, and they would die.
What is pathology the study of?
Food & Medicine
Health benefits
Both disorders and diseases
None of the options
2
Pathology is a field of study that involves diseases and disorders (a more proper defition is available on Google).
What types of traits are vestigial?
Ones that have limited function
Ones that have lost their function
Both of the other answers
None of the other answers
2
Vestigial traits are not selected for or selected against; therefore they usually provide none or a limited function for the organism.
What system does our society use to name organisms?
Binomial nomenclature
Binomial expansion
Quadratic equation
All of the answers
0
Binomial expansion is used in math to expand a binomial raised to a certain degree (ex: (x + 3)^7), and the quadratic equation provides a general solution to any quadratic.
What moves when gene flow occurs?
Genetic information
Populations of organisms
The children of organisms
None of the options
0
Remember that gene flow involved genes and the genome, NOT the organisms themselves!
What are phenotypes?
The traits of organisms
The genome
The genotype
All of them
0
Remember that GENotypes involve the GENome of an organism, and the phenotypes are the outside traits. Natural selection selects for specific phenotypes, and that affects the gene pool of an organism.
How many organisms die during a genetic bottleneck?
A small number
A few
None
A large number
3
When you pour water out of a bottle, not all of it comes out at once rapidly. There is a lot of water trying to force itself through a tiny space. If you remember that analogy, you can think of organisms as trying to force themselves through a bottleneck as well. However, only a few organisms make it through, and the rest of them do not survive.
Which are needed for natural selection?
Variation
Inheritance and Time
Selection
All of the options
3
Remember the acronym VIST to remember this.
What is another name for cladograms?
Tree diagrams
Plant displays
There is no other name
None of the options
0
This requires some memorization, but just try to visualize how a cladogram looks in your head. It will be quite similar to a tree.
What do specialists need?
Nothing; they are tolerant
Specific conditions
Animals to feed on
General conditions
1
SPECIALists will need SPECIAL or specific conditions in order to live.
What do generalists need?
Nothing; they are tolerant
Specific conditions
Animals to feed on
General conditions
3
GENERALists are tolerant, but they still require some conditions in order to live. As a result, they will need GENERAL conditions.
What did the human genome project identify?
Human chromosomes
All animals' chromosomes
Fish chromosomes
The human body
0
Keep in mind that the HUMAN genome project identified HUMAN chromosomes. There are so many organisms out there, and identifying all the genetic information of each and every one of them would be a very hefty task.
What does directional selection select for?
One extreme phenotype
An intermediate phenotype
Both extreme phenotypes
None of the options
0
Remember that directional selection selects for organisms towards ONE DIRECTION of the bell curve.
What does stabilizing selection select for?
One extreme phenotype
An intermediate phenotype
Both extreme phenotypes
None of the options
1
Remember that stabilizing selection selects for organisms in the center of the bell curve, and that is where the intermediate phenotype is located.
What does disruptive selection select for?
One extreme phenotype
An intermediate phenotype
Both extreme phenotypes
None of the options
2
Remember that disruptive selection disrupts the general shape of the bell curve and causes each end to grow. Those ends are where the extreme phenotypes lie.
How many chromosomes do humans have?
23
46
92
1024
1
Humans have 23 chromosomes from the mother and 23 from the father.
What are melanin pigments produced by?
Melanocytes
Melanosomes
Skin cells
All of the options
1
Melanin pigments are produced by organelles called melanosomes. Those organelles are produced by melanocytes, which are smaller cells located in skin cells.
