# SprintTyper

### About:
I made this program as the final project of my Java course in high school. It is is similar to [TypeRacer](https://typeracer.com), which is a game where you race against other people by typing. The game is meant to be educational, and it requires the users to type texts about biology. After they finish typing the texts, they go through a short quiz.

### Running the program:
1. Clone the repository, I don't recommend downloading each and every single individual file.
2. Compile all files and run `SprintTyper.java`.
